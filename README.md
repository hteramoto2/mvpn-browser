Micro VPN Browser
=================

A simple Android browser application that illustrates Citrix MAM SDK integration to support network tunneling to company's internal network: this is the source code for Micro VPN Browser app on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teramoto.microvpnbrowser).

Introduction
------------

[Citrix MAM SDK](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html) is a set of libraries provided to Citrix Endpoint Management customers to integrate customer-developed apps to take advantage of Citrix's MAM features and capabilities.

[Citrix MAM SDK Documentation](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration)

Citrix MAM SDK Version
----------------------

Micro VPN Browser supports the latest MAM SDK version 21.6.0.5.  

Getting Started
---------------

### Publishing Public App Store Micro VPN Browser to CEM Server
Download the MDX file (provided in the link below) and publish it as a regular public app store MDX app, similarly to Secure Mail and Secure Web.

<a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hteramoto2/mvpn-browser/master/MicroVPNBrowser.mdx">Download MDX File</a>


### Build an app for Managed Play Store Distribution (Private/Enterprise app)
#### Step 1
Configure maven repository on your root gradle project.

Citrix's official maven repository for MAM SDK is here: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-mam-sdks/develop/maven`.

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-mam-sdks/develop/maven" }
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    tasks.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile).all { kotlinOptions.allWarningsAsErrors = true }
}
```

#### Step 2
Set up signing keys for .mdx file generation step.  This can be done by creating a keystore.properties file at the project root folder.  The contents may look as below.  **Note:** Do not use double quotes for these values. 

```
keyAlias=key0
keyPassword=my5ecretP(a)ssword
storeFile=../../../AndroidKeyStore/keystore-file.jks
storePassword=my5ecretP(a)ssword2
```

#### Step 3
Micro VPN Browser app's Android Package Name is already used on the Google Play Store.  Any builds without modifying the package name will be rejected from the Play Store and the Managed Play Store.  To change the Package Name, create a debug.properties file at the project root folder.  The contents may look as below.  **Note:** Do not use double quotes for these values.

```
appPackageName=com.yourcompany.yourapp
versionCode=1
versionName=1.0
```

#### Step 4
Setup Citrix MAM SDK paths in the mamsdk.properties file.  Create this file at the project root folder. 

```
mamSdkVersion=21.6.0.5
mamToolSha256=6eb96f84750fbd56118413beefaa9bcaac46355d645ecb6ac10e1cbb45af014e
```

#### Step 5
Your application is now ready to be built.  Use the `gradlew build` command or use "Open an Exiting Project" in Android Studio.

#### Generating MDX File
To generate an MDX file for publishing as APK, run the following Gradle task:

```
    generateMdx
```

The MDX file will be located under `app\build\outputs\apk\release`.

##### Running into issues while generating MDX file
For the first time generating the MDX file, you may run into the following error.

```
> Task :app:generateMdx

```

**Solution**

Create an android_settings.txt file under your App's **tools** folder.

**Example:**

`C:\Users\username\AndroidStudioProjects\mvpn-browser\app\tools\android_settings.txt`

And populate the file with a PATH variable pointing to the build-tools and JDK folder. 

**Hereâ€™s my example from android_settings.txt:**

`PATH=C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\30.0.3;C:\Users\username\Documents\jdk-16\bin`

#### Publishing to Managed Play Store
After generating the APK file and MDX file from the previously performed Gradle task, you will need to upload the app to the Managed Google Play Store and configure MDX on the CEM server.

##### Uploading APK to Managed Google Play Store
First, upload your APK file to Managed Google Play Store.  (Assumption: you have already configured Android Enterprise on the CEM Server.  If not, please refer to: [Android Enterprise](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-endpoint-management/device-management/android/android-enterprise.html))

![Managed Play Store](docs/EnterpriseApp.PNG "Begin Enterprise publishing flow")

Start the APK upload process by clicking on the Upload button for Android Enterprise.
![Managed Play Store](docs/Ent-configure.PNG "Upload Enterprise app")

The Google Play iframe will open, allowing you to upload a new app or update an existing app.  Click the plus icon on the bottom right hand corner to upload a new app.
![Managed Play Store](docs/PublishApp.PNG "Upload Enterprise app to Google Play Store")

Upload your APK and provide the necessary details for publishing to the Managed Google Play Store.
![Managed Play Store](docs/UploadManagedPlayStore.PNG "Upload APK to Managed Play Store")

It may take a few minutes for the app to become available on the Managed Google Play Store.  Leave/exit the Enterprise App Publishing flow.  Do not worry, the app would have been already uploaded to Google; Citrix does not need to know this nor record it in their databases.
![Managed Play Store](docs/ExitEnterprisePublishing.PNG "Exit enterprise publishing flow")

Now, publish your MDX file to the CEM server.
![Managed Play Store](docs/PublishMDX.PNG "Publish MDX file")

Upload and finish publishing your MDX file.

Upgrading From Previous Version of MAM SDK
------------------------------------------

You may run into build issues when updating the to the latest MAM SDK version.  Here are some examples.

### Manifest Merged Failed

    Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugMainManifest'.
    > Manifest merger failed : Attribute application@theme value=(@style/Theme.MicroVPNBrowser) from AndroidManifest.xml:17:9-53
        is also present at [com.citrix.android:authmanagerlitelib:Release_21.5.0-1] AndroidManifest.xml:15:9-40 value=(@style/AppTheme).
        Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:theme"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:11:5-29:19 to override.

#### Workaround

Add `xmlns:tools` line in AndroidManifest.xml, `manifest` tag.

    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        package="com.teramoto.microvpnbrowser"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

Add `tools:replace` in the `application` tag

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/Theme.MicroVPNBrowser"
        tools:replace="android:theme">

### Kotlin Version Mismatch

    > Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED
    w: Runtime JAR files in the classpath should have the same version. These files were found in the classpath:
        C:/Users/haroldt/.gradle/caches/transforms-2/files-2.1/78d49c020187138fd912e336a9ca0a28/jetified-kotlin-stdlib-jdk7-1.3.30.jar (version 1.3)

    w: Some runtime JAR files in the classpath have an incompatible version. Consider removing them from the classpath
    e: warnings found and -Werror specified

#### Fix
Include jdk8 which has dependency to jdk7 as well.

    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:$kotlin_version"

Troubleshooting Guide
----------------------
I had my fair share of learning experience when developing this app.  I will attempt to use this section to help other developers who may run into the same issues.

### Issue 1: NoClassDefFoundError org/apache/http/HttpHost

#### Cause

MAM SDK uses legacy Apache http library.  Your app will need to explicitly allow using this library.

#### Fix

Add the following in AndroidManifest.xml's `application` section.

    <uses-library android:name="org.apache.http.legacy" android:required="false" />

### Issue 2: Targeting `targetSdkVersion` to 30

Google has updated the [Play Store requirements](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk) to target SDK version to 30 for new apps for August 2021 and November 2021 for app updates.  MAM SDK integrated apps targeted for SDK version 30 will fail with this error.

    2021-04-27 19:36:05.557 16321-16387/? E/ActivityThread: Failed to find provider info for com.citrix.work.MDXProvider

#### Cause

Android SDK version 30 added new restriction to [package visiblity](https://developer.android.com/training/package-visibility).

#### Fix

Add the following in AndroidManifest.xml's `manifest` section.

    <queries>
        <package android:name="com.zenprise" />
        <package android:name="com.citrix.Receiver" />
    </queries>

### Issue 3: Generating MDX File for Android App Bundle and Play App Signing

App that uses Android App Bundle and Play App Signing cannot generate a correct MDX file.

#### Cause

Google has updated the Play Store requirement for new app to use the [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) starting August 2021.  Android App Bundle requires the developer to opt-in to [Play App Signing](https://play.google.com/console/about/keymanagement/). With Android App Bundle, your app will no longer generate the APK for submission to Play Store.  Also, Play App Signing will remove the burden for developers to safely manage their signing keys.  APK and signing keys are both required for generating MDX files, however.

#### Fix

Unfortunately, we will need to wait for a fix from Citrix.  You may want to attempt to contact Citrix to get further instructions.  When raising issue with Citrix, I suggest to download and provide the public signing certificate from Google Play Console to Citrix.
